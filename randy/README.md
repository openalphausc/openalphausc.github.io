Our Mission
Bring a game from conception to an open-alpha release each development cycle (semester/year)
Build games with awesome people.
That's the idea Open Alpha was founded on. As a member, you'll make games with fellow students from the world's best games school.  You'll bring your own talent and vision to a real-world project in an exciting and fast-paced development environment. And best of all, you'll join the tight-knit Open Alpha family and partake in awesome community events throughout the semester.
